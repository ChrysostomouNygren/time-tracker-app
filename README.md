# Time tracker app
School assignment 1 for the course web- and mobile application development. Styked for mobile first.

## Installation
```bash
npm install
npm install -g json-server
```

## How to use
You need two terminals open, one for the server and one for the frontend.
```bash
npm run dev
npm run json:server
```

### Packages
[json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) - for the server  
[react-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com/) - for routing  
[axios](https://axios-http.com/) - instead of fetch 

[timer-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/timer-node) - timer package, so I didn't have to write it all by myself  
[nanoID](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nanoid) - ID generator  
[react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) - Modals, dropdowns, navbars and styling.

### Styling
The app is very minimalistic.  
I used [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)s styling, and the things I wanted to change I simply overwrote in inline css.
